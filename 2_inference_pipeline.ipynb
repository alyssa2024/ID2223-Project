As can be observed, as the epochs increase, the signals present a more realistic form. In this work, the EWT ﬁlter is a post-processing stage that is applied to the synthetic signal generated with 2000 training epochs, in order to reduce the noise level of the generator output. Therefore, the EWT ﬁlter is not part of the training loop for the GAN. This number of epochs was determined after observing the synthetic signals obtained at diﬀerent training points (from 100 epochs to 12,000 epochs).

Appl. Sci. 2020, 10, 7003 8 of 16 4. Experiments and Results The proposed GAN model was trained for a total of 2000 epochs. Figure 8 shows sample output signals generated at diﬀerent epochs. As can be observed, as the epochs increase, the signals present a more realistic form. In this work, the EWT ﬁlter is a post-processing stage that is applied to the synthetic signal generated with 2000 training epochs, in order to reduce the noise level of the generator output. Therefore, the EWT ﬁlter is not part of the training loop for the GAN. This number of epochs was determined after observing the synthetic signals obtained at diﬀerent training points (from 100 epochs to 12,000 epochs). It was observed that from 2000 epochs, the synthetic signal has a shape very similar to a natural signal, but with a relatively high noise level, as shown in Figure 8E. Therefore, it was decided to generate th', 'score': 0.14285714285714285}, {'source_id': 'PDU98SKK#chunk-11', 'paper_id': 'PDU98SKK', 'content': 'omposed of the same representative beats. As a result, the signals created by this framework exhibit no variation in RR intervals or morphological properties. On the other hand, the signals produced by an ECG simulator can vary with different heart rates, but the morphological traits of a QRS complex are not changed in a 10-second signal. TTS-GAN appears to alleviate this issue; however, the P and T waveforms remain undesirable, with sharp peaks and irrational inclinations. In contrast, our proposal work has handled these challenges with varying heart rates and appropriate QRS-complex forms. P and T wave allocations and morphological traits are also clear and acceptable. Thanks to these characteristics, the signals produced from our framework can help physicians to simulate real-like signals for abnormal cases and replace the reliable ECG simulator.

The deep-learning ECG generator, which has been proven to efficiently produce high-fidelity one-dimensional signals in speech synthesis and music generation, is another approach for solving imbalanced data and simulating problems. For example, a variational auto-encoder (VAE) based model has been explored in the study of Peng et al. (2020) [12] to convert text to speech. Generative adversarial networks (GAN) have also shown promising results for the generation of artificial audio, such as in the study of Binkowski et al. (2019) [1] and Su et al. (2021) [17]. Regarding the generation of long ECG signals, several previous studies have investigated this field using GAN but with different purposes. For example, Vo et al. (2021) [19] used P2E-WGAN to reconstruct ECG signals from realistic Photoplethysmogram (PPG) data.
