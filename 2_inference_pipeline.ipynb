      "PAPER METADATA: {'T55ZK2Y7': {'title': 'PCG Signal Acquisition and Classification for Heart Failure Detection: Recent Advances and Implementation of Memory-Efficient Classifiers for Edge Computing-Based Wearable Devices', 'abstract': 'Conventional diagnostic tools for cardiovascular diseases usually employ expensive instrumentation and require specialized medical staff. An inexpensive and non-invasive alternative is the phonocardiogram (PCG). This paper presents the development of classifiers for binary (Normal/Pathological) and multiclass classifications of PCG signals. The latter discerns between a subset of heart diseases (mitral valve prolapse (MVP), coronary disease (CAD), and benign murmurs (Benign)). Two balanced datasets were created from the Physionet 2016/CinC database, consisting of 10104 and 13136 5-s frames. A custom preprocessing chain includes denoising, normalizing, and splitting the PCG signals, making them suitable to extract the scalar features set, constituting the training and test set. Several ML/DL models (e.g., SVMs (Support Vector Machines), k-NNs (k-Nearest Neighbors), and NNs (Neural Networks)) were trained and tested to classify the PCG signals. For binary classification, three different NNs have reached 96.0%, 95.9%, and 93.4% accuracy, and 95.9%, 96.0%, and 93.3% F1-scores, respectively. However, k-NN classifiers provide higher accuracy (up to 98.7%) than NNs but require much larger memory (up to 11 MB). As for the multiclass classification, three custom NNs have achieved 96.0%, 95.8%, and 94.7% accuracy with 735 kB max memory occupation. The developed classifiers provide a good balance between complexity and performance, with the latter not dependent on signal quality. In the feature engineering phase, the heart sound segmentation was not performed to make the classifiers suitable for resource-limited platforms.'}, 'BX8G68KQ': {'title': 'A Comprehensive Overview of Heart Sound Analysis Using Machine Learning Methods', 'abstract': 'Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a prevalent cause of mortality worldwide, and the traditional cardiovascular disease diagnosis has relied heavily on stethoscope-based heart sound auscultations. Hence, the development of medical systems has led to several machine learning (ML)-related studies for analysing heart sounds using phonocardiograms (PCGs). Although this process enables the detection of additional mechanical activity information about the heart muscle, various crucial gaps (background noise, unbalanced datasets, and irrelevant extracted features) are still observed. Therefore, this review examined the advancements in diagnosing heart sounds using ML-based PCG signal analysis. The evaluation process involved three datasets in the past five years (2019–2024): the PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology (CinC) Challenge (2016–2022) and the Yaseen Khan 2018 datasets. This review also comprehensively explained the importance of heart sounds in cardiovascular disease diagnosis. Moreover, these studies demonstrated an overview of the most effective methods in handling datasets, pre-processing of PCG signals (filtering, segmentation, and normalisation), PCG signal processing techniques (feature extraction and feature selection), and machine learning models (classification). Several directions concerning heart sound diagnosis for future studies are then presented, which can serve as a reference point for diagnosing cardiovascular diseases.'}, 'IZB6XZRC': {'title': 'Synthetic Time Series Data Generation for Healthcare Applications: A PCG Case Study', 'abstract': 'The generation of high-quality medical time series data is essential for advancing healthcare diagnostics and safeguarding patient privacy. Specifically, synthesizing realistic phonocardiogram (PCG) signals offers significant potential as a cost-effective and efficient tool for cardiac disease pre-screening. Despite its potential, the synthesis of PCG signals for this specific application received limited attention in research. In this study, we employ and compare three state-of-the-art generative models from different categories — WaveNet, DoppelGANger, and DiffWave — to generate high-quality PCG data. We use data from the George B. Moody PhysioNet Challenge 2022. Our methods are evaluated using various metrics widely used in the previous literature in the domain of time series data generation, such as mean absolute error and maximum mean discrepancy. Our results demonstrate that the generated PCG data closely resembles the original datasets, indicating the effectiveness of our generative models in producing realistic synthetic PCG data. In our future work, we plan to incorporate this method into a data augmentation pipeline to synthesize abnormal PCG signals with heart murmurs, in order to address the current scarcity of abnormal data. We hope to improve the robustness and accuracy of diagnostic tools in cardiology, enhancing their effectiveness in detecting heart murmurs.'}, 'R7JAHFY6': {'title': 'ECG Generation Based on Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models', 'abstract': 'Arrhythmia diseases seriously damage people’s life and health, and identifying abnormal points in ECG signals by deep neural networks is an effective method for detecting arrhythmias. However, their accuracy is often limited by the biased data distribution of the training set, and a large number of labeled ECG signals are usually harder to obtain. Therefore, this paper proposes to synthesize virtual heart beat data by denoising diffusion probability model (DDPM) based on the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database to complement the real data. Three different methods for generating heartbeat signals are also used, which are (i) generating heartbeat signals directly, (ii) generating time-frequency maps of heartbeats and transforming them into heartbeat signals, and (iii) generating sub-signals of heartbeats and fusing them into complete heartbeat signals. Regarding the evaluation of the synthesized signals, we compare the advantages and disadvantages of the three heartbeat generation methods by four metrics: DTW, PCC, ED and KLD. The experimental results showed that the optimum values of 4.37, 17.09, 0.972 and 0.0094 were obtained for ED, DTW of method (i) and PCC, KLD of method (iii), respectively.'}, 'WBP9IWFM': {'title': 'PhysioBank, PhysioToolkit, and PhysioNet: Components of a New Research Resource for Complex Physiologic Signals', 'abstract': 'Abstract               —The newly inaugurated Research Resource for Complex Physiologic Signals, which was created under the auspices of the National Center for Research Resources of the National Institutes of Health, is intended to stimulate current research and new investigations in the study of cardiovascular and other complex biomedical signals. The resource has 3 interdependent components. PhysioBank is a large and growing archive of well-characterized digital recordings of physiological signals and related data for use by the biomedical research community. It currently includes databases of multiparameter cardiopulmonary, neural, and other biomedical signals from healthy subjects and from patients with a variety of conditions with major public health implications, including life-threatening arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, sleep apnea, neurological disorders, and aging. PhysioToolkit is a library of open-source software for physiological signal processing and analysis, the detection of physiologically significant events using both classic techniques and novel methods based on statistical physics and nonlinear dynamics, the interactive display and characterization of signals, the creation of new databases, the simulation of physiological and other signals, the quantitative evaluation and comparison of analysis methods, and the analysis of nonstationary processes. PhysioNet is an on-line forum for the dissemination and exchange of recorded biomedical signals and open-source software for analyzing them. It provides facilities for the cooperative analysis of data and the evaluation of proposed new algorithms. In addition to providing free electronic access to PhysioBank data and PhysioToolkit software via the World Wide Web (http://www.physionet.org), PhysioNet offers services and training via on-line tutorials to assist users with varying levels of expertise.'}}\n",

A study by Prasad and Thalluri,. [32] observed that PCG signals possessed high sensitivity and low strength, which rendered them susceptible to noise interference. Therefore, filtering methods are necessary to remove unwanted noise from PCG signals. Generally, analogue (or digital)- based signal processing techniques are utilised to remove the noise [29]. This feature suggests that differential amplifiers and filters should be used to prevent interference [16]. For example, the Butterworth filters are the most prevalent techniques employed in literature for noise suppression, such as low band-pass [2], high band-pass [33], and band-pass filter [16]. A segmentation process involves dividing PCG signals into four segments: S1, systole, S2, and diastole (see Figure 2). This process extracts specific information for aiding the detection of normal and abnormal heart sounds [34]. Systole is the cardiac cycle phase when the heart muscle contracts, pushing blood out of the chambers into the arteries. The ventricles contract during this process, forcing blood into the pulmonary artery from the right ventricle and into the aorta from the left ventricle. This phase is also measured from the beginning of ventricular contraction to the closure of the aortic and pulmonary valves. Alternatively, diastole is the cardiac cycle phase when the heart muscle relaxes and fills with blood.', 'score': 0.1}], 'stats': {'num_items': 1, 'unique_papers': 1}, 'token_usage': {'estimated_tokens': 224, 'max_tokens': 2000}}\n",
