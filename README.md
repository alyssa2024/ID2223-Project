# ID2223-Project Qwen-8B Research Agent with Zotero-Driven RAG
## This repository implements a research assistant agent built on Qwen-8B, designed for paper-centric reasoning over a continuously updating academic library managed in Zotero.
The system integrates:
* Zotero CSV as the paper source of truth
* Feature Groups (Hopsworks) as the structured research database
* Vector embeddings (RAG) for semantic search
* LLM Agent (Qwen-8B) for tool-aware reasoning
