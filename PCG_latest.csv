However, the available heart sound databases are not yet large enough to train generalized machine learning models. Therefore, there is interest in the development of algorithms capable of generating heart sounds that could augment current databases. In this article, we propose a model based on generative adversary networks (GANs) to generate normal synthetic heart sounds. Additionally, a denoising algorithm is implemented using the empirical wavelet transform (EWT), allowing a decrease in the number of epochs and the computational cost that the GAN model requires. A distortion metric (mel–cepstral distortion) was used to objectively assess the quality of synthetic heart sounds. The proposed method was favorably compared with a mathematical model that is based on the morphology of the phonocardiography (PCG) signal published as the state of the art. Additionally, diﬀerent heart sound classiﬁcation models proposed as state-of-the-art were also used to test the performance of such models when the GAN-generated synthetic signals were used as test dataset. In this experiment, good accuracy results were obtained with most of the implemented models, suggesting that the GAN-generated sounds correctly capture the characteristics of natural heart sounds.","2020-10-08","2025-09-22 10:05:03","2025-09-22 10:05:04","2025-09-22 10:05:03","7003","","19","10","","Applied Sciences","","","","","","","","en","https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\alyssa\Zotero\storage\J6CFPY56\Narváez和Percybrooks - 2020 - Synthesis of Normal Heart Sounds Using Generative Adversarial Networks and Empirical Wavelet Transfo.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, their accuracy is often limited by the biased data distribution of the training set, and a large number of labeled ECG signals are usually harder to obtain. Therefore, this paper proposes to synthesize virtual heart beat data by denoising diffusion probability model (DDPM) based on the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database to complement the real data. Three different methods for generating heartbeat signals are also used, which are (i) generating heartbeat signals directly, (ii) generating time-frequency maps of heartbeats and transforming them into heartbeat signals, and (iii) generating sub-signals of heartbeats and fusing them into complete heartbeat signals. Regarding the evaluation of the synthesized signals, we compare the advantages and disadvantages of the three heartbeat generation methods by four metrics: DTW, PCC, ED and KLD. The experimental results showed that the optimum values of 4.37, 17.09, 0.972 and 0.0094 were obtained for ED, DTW of method (i) and PCC, KLD of method (iii), respectively.","2024-12-01","2025-09-22 10:05:06","2025-09-22 10:05:06","2025-09-22 10:05:06","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\alyssa\Zotero\storage\JZPFTQVT\Wang 等 - 2024 - ECG Generation Based on Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2024 Computing in Cardiology Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper presents a systematic comparison of four distinct models for heart murmur detection: two specialized convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and two zero-shot universal audio transformers (BEATs), evaluated using fixed-length and heart cycle normalization approaches. Utilizing the PhysioNet2022 dataset, a custom heart cycle normalization method tailored to individual cardiac rhythms is introduced. The findings indicate the following AUROC values: the CNN model with fixed-length windowing achieves 79.5%, the CNN model with heart cycle normalization scores 75.4%, the BEATs transformer with fixed-length windowing achieves 65.7%, and the BEATs transformer with heart cycle normalization results in 70.1%. The findings indicate that physiological signal constraints, especially those introduced by different normalization strategies, have a substantial impact on model performance. The research provides evidence-based guidelines for architecture selection in clinical settings, emphasizing the need for a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency. Although specialized CNNs demonstrate superior performance overall, the zero-shot transformer models may offer promising efficiency advantages during development, such as faster training and evaluation cycles, despite their lower classification accuracy.

Although this process enables the detection of additional mechanical activity information about the heart muscle, various crucial gaps (background noise, unbalanced datasets, and irrelevant extracted features) are still observed. Therefore, this review examined the advancements in diagnosing heart sounds using ML-based PCG signal analysis.

Moreover, these studies demonstrated an overview of the most effective methods in handling datasets, pre-processing of PCG signals (filtering, segmentation, and normalisation), PCG signal processing techniques (feature extraction and feature selection), and machine learning models (classification).

The latter discerns between a subset of heart diseases (mitral valve prolapse (MVP), coronary disease (CAD), and benign murmurs (Benign)). Two balanced datasets were created from the Physionet 2016/CinC database, consisting of 10104 and 13136 5-s frames. A custom preprocessing chain includes denoising, normalizing, and splitting the PCG signals, making them suitable to extract the scalar features set, constituting the training and test set. Several ML/DL models (e.g., SVMs (Support Vector Machines), k-NNs (k-Nearest Neighbors), and NNs (Neural Networks)) were trained and tested to classify the PCG signals. For binary classification, three different NNs have reached 96.0%, 95.9%, and 93.4% accuracy, and 95.9%, 96.0%, and 93.3% F1-scores, respectively. However, k-NN classifiers provide higher accuracy (up to 98.7%) than NNs but require much larger memory (up to 11 MB). As for the multiclass classification, three custom NNs have achieved 96.0%, 95.8%, and 94.7% accuracy with 735 kB max memory occupation. The developed classifiers provide a good balance between complexity and performance, with the latter not dependent on signal quality.

This study addresses these limitations by employing generative adversarial networks (GANs) to synthesize realistic CAD-like heart sound segments, augmenting existing datasets to improve classification performance. A Progressive Wasserstein GAN architecture was implemented to generate high-quality audio segments that accurately capture CAD heart sounds' spectral and temporal characteristics. The quality of synthetic audio was assessed using the Fréchet Audio Distance (FAD), achieving scores of 1.43 and 2.23 when compared to reference CAD and healthy samples, respectively. Novel post-processing steps, including bandpass filtering, further enhanced the fidelity of the synthetic samples. By augmenting the imbalanced heart sound dataset with these samples, we observed substantial improvements in the performance of five classification models. The GAN-augmented training set outperformed traditional augmentation and cost-sensitive learning methods, demonstrating superior sensitivity, specificity, and precision.

However, the paucity of labelled data inhibits classification models' training. Researchers have turned to generative deep learning techniques combined with signal processing to augment the existing data and improve cardiac auscultation classification models to overcome this challenge. However, the primary focus of prior studies has been on model performance as opposed to model robustness. Robustness, in this case, is defined as both the in-distribution and out-of-distribution performance by measures such as Matthew's correlation coefficient. This work shows that more robust abnormal heart sound classifiers can be trained using an augmented dataset. The augmentations consist of traditional audio approaches and the creation of synthetic audio conditionally generated using the WaveGrad and DiffWave diffusion models. It is found that both the in-distribution and out-of-distribution performance can be improved over various datasets when training a convolutional neural network-based classification model with this augmented dataset. With the performance increase encompassing not only accuracy but also balanced accuracy and Matthew's correlation coefficient, an augmented dataset significantly contributes to resolving issues of imbalanced datasets. This, in turn, helps provide a more general and robust classifier.","2025-06-17","2026-01-06 19:37:49","2026-01-06 19:37:49","2026-01-06 19:37:49","","","","","","","Generative Deep Learning and Signal Processing for Data Augmentation of Cardiac Auscultation Signals","","","","","arXiv","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:2410.10125 [cs] version: 2","","C:\Users\alyssa\Zotero\storage\8TGWC4IX\Abbott 等 - 2025 - Generative Deep Learning and Signal Processing for Data Augmentation of Cardiac Auscultation Signals.pdf; C:\Users\alyssa\Zotero\storage\HYU59Q2M\2410.html","","","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science - Signal Processing; Computer Science - Sound; Electrical Engineering and Systems Science - Audio and Speech Processing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2410.10125","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the existing heart sound database state is not sufficient to train a large number of deep learning models and is not balanced -- the normal heart sounds are always more present than abnormal heart sounds. Hence, we are interested in algorithms that can generate heart sounds as they can enhance the current database state. We enter the field of large-scale modelling in medical synthesis by proposing a latent diffusion model for heart sound generation, which can generate highly realistic heart sounds. We further guide the synthesis process through text prompts and labels, revealing the research field of prompted heart sound synthesis. In terms of experimental results, our proposed method achieves good results compared to existing mathematical models. At the same time, when the generated audio is used as an unlabelled dataset in semi-supervised learning, it shows an improvement effect on the classification model. This indicates that the heart sounds generated by the diffusion model bear great value.","2025-03-21","2026-01-06 19:39:26","2026-01-06 19:39:26","2026-01-06 19:39:26","1314-1319","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","Xi'an, China","en","https://doi.org/10.15223/policy-029","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\alyssa\Zotero\storage\I4QBFTJX\Tan 等 - 2025 - A Latent Diffusion Model for Heart Sound Synthesis.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2025 4th International Symposium on Computer Applications and Information Technology (ISCAIT)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Early detection is critical, creating a demand for accurate and inexpensive pre-screening methods. Deep learning has recently been applied to classify abnormal heart sounds indicative of CVDs using synchronised phonocardiogram (PCG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, as well as multichannel PCG (mPCG). However, state-of-the-art architectures remain underutilised due to the limited availability of synchronised and multichannel datasets. Augmented datasets and pre-trained models provide a pathway to overcome these limitations, enabling transformer-based architectures to be trained effectively on smaller datasets. This work combines traditional signal processing with denoising diffusion models, WaveGrad and DiffWave, to create an augmented dataset to fine-tune a Wav2Vec 2.0-based classifier on multimodal and multichannel heart sound datasets.","2025-12-08","2026-01-06 19:43:49","2026-01-06 19:43:49","2026-01-06 19:43:49","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv","","en","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:2509.11606 [cs]","","C:\Users\alyssa\Zotero\storage\6FBGZYQH\Marocchi 等 - 2025 - Scaling to Multimodal and Multichannel Heart Sound Classification with Synthetic and Augmented Biosi.pdf","","","Computer Science - Machine Learning; Electrical Engineering and Systems Science - Signal Processing; Computer Science - Sound","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2509.11606","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To bridge this, we introduce H-LDM, a Hierarchical Latent Diffusion Model for generating clinically accurate and controllable PCG signals from structured metadata. Our approach features: (1) a multi-scale VAE that learns a physiologically-disentangled latent space, separating rhythm, heart sounds, and murmurs; (2) a hierarchical text-to-biosignal pipeline that leverages rich clinical metadata for fine-grained control over 17 distinct conditions; and (3) an interpretable diffusion process guided by a novel Medical Attention module. Experiments on the PhysioNet CirCor dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving a Fre´chet Audio Distance of 9.7, a 92% attribute disentanglement score, and 87.1% clinical validity confirmed by cardiologists. Augmenting diagnostic models with our synthetic data improves the accuracy of rare disease classification by 11.3%. H-LDM establishes a new direction for data augmentation in cardiac diagnostics, bridging data scarcity with interpretable clinical insights.","2025-11-18","2026-01-10 19:34:54","2026-01-10 19:34:54","2026-01-10 19:34:54","","","","","","","H-LDM","","","","","arXiv","","en","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:2511.14312 [cs]","","C:\Users\alyssa\Zotero\storage\32H4AJP9\Xu 等 - 2025 - H-LDM Hierarchical Latent Diffusion Models for Controllable and Interpretable PCG Synthesis from Cl.pdf","","","Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science - Machine Learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2511.14312","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cardiovascular monitoring with body-worn sensor devices like sensor patches allows for the detection of such signs while preserving the freedom and comfort of patients. However, the analysis of the sensor data must be robust, reliable, efficient, and highly accurate. Deep learning methods can automate data interpretation, reducing the workload of clinicians. In this work, we analyze the feasibility of applying deep learning models to the classification of synchronized electrocardiogram (ECG) and phonocardiogram (PCG) recordings on resource-constrained medical edge devices. We propose a convolutional neural network with early fusion of data to solve a binary classification problem. We train and validate our model on the synchronized ECG and PCG recordings from the Physionet Challenge 2016 dataset. Our approach reduces memory footprint and compute cost by three orders of magnitude compared to the state-of-the-art while maintaining competitive accuracy. We demonstrate the applicability of our proposed model on medical edge devices by analyzing energy consumption on a microcontroller and an experimental sensor device setup, confirming that on-device inference can be more energyefficient than continuous data streaming.","2025-10-21","2026-01-10 19:36:18","2026-01-10 19:36:18","2026-01-10 19:36:18","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv","","en","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:2510.18668 [cs]","","C:\Users\alyssa\Zotero\storage\8NB3BF2H\Ibrahim 等 - 2025 - Prototyping an End-to-End Multi-Modal Tiny-CNN for Cardiovascular Sensor Patches.pdf","","","Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition; Computer Science - Machine Learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2510.18668","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
